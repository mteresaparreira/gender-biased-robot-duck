Negative: it responded ""emm"" as if it was listening but at the wrong pace, often jumped in when I was still talking aloud, which is not very common between conversations with human beings unless they want to cut in and say something on their own. It is a little annoying. Also I am not a fan of the robotic voice,  I think having a human being doing a voice over and use their voice is better.
